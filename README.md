# APB-Protocol-Verification-in-SystemVerilog

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a **SystemVerilog-based verification environment** built from scratch to verify an **APB slave design**.  
It follows a modular, UVM-style structure with key components: **Generator, Driver, Monitor, Scoreboard, Environment, and Transaction classes**.  
The testbench supports **random stimulus generation, coverage-driven verification, and checking against a scoreboard reference model**.
